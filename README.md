# Calculator in Laravel and Vue



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/529d7228-3a05-41b5-9901-f7e564710a2b



## Goal
### Requirements
Build an API that supports four types of calculation operators:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Division
- Multiplication
Every calculation should be stored for historical reference.

A calculator interface should be created (Vue.js) that allows the user enter their calculation and receive a response.
A "ticker tape" interface should be built that shows all previous calculations with the ability to delete an individual calculation or clear all previous calculations.

### Stretch Goal
To really impress the customers, your calculator should support more complex calculation chains and even additional calculation operators:
sqrt((((9*9)/12)+(13-4))*2)^2)

- The User Model is not tested, as it is a default Laravel model. The rest has coverage.
- Run `php artisan db:seed --class=CalculationSeeder` to seed the database with some calculations.
- Run `php artisan test` to run the tests.
